#RaizR

This application will explore the geographic and historical origins of English words, creating an interactive tool that allows users to input a word (e.g., orange, lagniappe, algebra) and see a mapped visualization of how that word traveled across the world before entering English.

The goal is to combine etymological data with geospatial visualization, offering both linguistic insight and a historical sense of cultural exchange.

Objectives
✅ Build a dataset or API connection that links English words to their etymological roots and geographic origin points.
✅ Create a backend function that can trace the “journey” of a word through languages or cultures (e.g., Sanskrit → Arabic → Spanish → English).
✅ Use a Python-based visualization library (e.g., Folium, Plotly, or Geopandas) to plot origin points and connecting paths on a world map.
✅ Allow users to input a word and dynamically generate its origin map.
✅ Provide summary insights — e.g., common source regions, top contributing languages, or historical timelines.

Tools & Libraries
Pandas → to manage word-origin datasets.

Requests / API clients → to query etymology APIs (if available) or parse public sources.

Folium / Plotly / Geopandas → to plot geographic maps with interactive points and lines.

NLTK or SpaCy → for linguistic processing if needed.

Jupyter Notebook → for exploratory analysis, final storytelling, and presentation.

Data Sources
Etymonline — rich etymology database (may require scraping or licensing for bulk data).

Wiktionary — open-source dictionary with etymology fields.

Lexicala API / Oxford API — commercial options if needed.

Geocoding Services — to assign longitude/latitude to place names.

Planned Features
🔍 Input box: user enters an English word.

🌍 Map output: shows the word’s historical path (as a sequence of points/lines) on a world map.

📜 Hover / tooltip info: explains each step (e.g., from Arabic “naranj” → Old French “pomme d’orenge” → English “orange”).

📊 Dashboard view (optional): aggregate insights on loanword patterns, top source countries, most influential languages.

Challenges
Getting consistent, structured etymological data.

Handling ambiguous or multi-origin words.

Mapping historical places to modern coordinates accurately.

Deciding how detailed the “journey” should be (just last jump? full path?).

Success Criteria
Users can input a word and see a map that traces its etymological journey.

The system can handle at least 100 common English loanwords.

Clear, interactive visualizations using Folium or Plotly.

Well-documented notebook or app explaining methods and findings.

Stretch Goals
Build a web app interface (using Streamlit or Flask).

Allow batch queries (e.g., map all Arabic loanwords in English).

Add timeline animations showing when words entered English.

Integrate word frequency data (Google Ngram) for historical popularity trends.
